## About QHack QML Challenges

The QML Challenge contains 12 individual problems, ranging in difficulty from building basic 
quantum circuits to implementing QML workflows. The problems can be tackled in any order, 
and harder questions are worth more points. The problems can be tackled individually or 
as part of a team (limit of one account per team).

**The QML Challenges will remain open during the QHack Open Hackathon**. 

Achieving a high rank on the [QML Challenge Scoreboard](https://challenge.qhack.ai/public) will improve your chances of claiming the Open Hackathon Grand Prize of summer internships at CERN.
